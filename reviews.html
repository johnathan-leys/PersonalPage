                I don't review everything I read, just ones that stand out or that I have certain thoughts about. Generally these are in order of most recently read, but not always. I've really only started writing these in 2024, maybe I'll
                get around to reviewing things I've read a while ago, but most of those will require a re-read (which I actually do fairly often). I try not to just summarize the story, but sometimes a small summary is needed.

                I enjoyed Michael Lewis's <em>The Big Short</em> previously, and was curious about the content of 
                <em>Flash Boys</em>, as I had become interested in Quant/High Frequency Trading over the summer of 2023.
                I've always had an interest in finance, but diving into more complex topics drew my eye, and Lewis has always
                been good at writing about the stories surrounding complicated events without much confusion.
            </p><p>
                <em>Flash Boys</em> focuses on a group of traders, programmers, and other relevant figures in the 2000s who witnessed
                the effects of the transformation of Wall Street to an electronic market. It leads off by describing how millions of dollars
                were spent laying a nearly perfectly straight fiber line from New Jersey to Chicago, all in order to save a few milliseconds when
                sending trades between cities. With the importance of speed well established, Lewis describes how a group led by Brad Katsuyama
                discovered how HFT and other firms were able to use their massive speed advantages from new fiber lines and other developments
                to effectively front-run orders by seeing orders sent to certain exchanges and being fast enough to beat these orders to other
                exchanges before the original orders could be fully executed. This was one of many techniques likely utilized by these firms to reap massive profits
                in the digital market. This main group goes on to create a new exchange designed to be
                "more fair" for retail traders. The book also uses the conviction of a Goldman Sachs programmer to demonstrate how firms
                were becoming extremely secretive about their advantages, and Lewis seems to believe he was convicted due to 
                the non-technical jury being unable to understand common practices such as open-source code as well as complicated financial markets and techniques.
            </p><p>
                Lewis provides great commentary and a story in his book, and provides enough basic technical/financial knowledge for
                an average reader to understand many complicated concepts well enough for the story to make sense. Although I myself am
                intersted in finance, I believe the story told would be entertaining enough for somebeody with little to no interest to enjoy. 
                While Lewis certainly has his biases, the story does not seem to be deceiving and it is usually pretty obvious when his own
                opinions are present. Anyone wanting to learn more can certainly do the research and come away either agreeing or disagreeing with him.
                Overall, it was an good read presented in the typical style of Michael Lewis, which was both entertainng and mildly educational.
                I would reccomend for anyone with a slight interest in finance or network/computational fields.
