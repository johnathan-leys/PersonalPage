            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Welcome to my personal page. I am currently 22 years old working as a software integration engineer in the Detroit Metropolitan Area.
                 Here, you can find personal and professional information about me as well as whatever else I decide is relevant to the page.

            <h2>Professional Details</h2>
            <p>
                I am currently working for General Motors as a Fuel Cell Software Integration Engineer. I primarily work on the fuel cell controller 
                for GM's <a href="https://www.gmhydrotec.com/product/public/us/en/hydrotec/Home.html#beginning">HYDROTEC</a>. This is my first rotation in 
                GM's rotational TRACK program, where I will have 2 rotations each a year long before deciding on a permanant role with the company.
            </p>
            <p>
                Prior to this role, I have interned at PURVIS Systems, naval defense contractor located in RI, and at Jacobs Solutions. I started at PURVIS while still in high school and continued working there
                for 4 years while attending the University of Maine. I then interned at Jacobs to experience a larger company and living in a city. At UMaine, I studied Computer Engineering and focused on embedded systems.

            <h2>Personal Life</h2>
            <p>
                In my free time, I enjoy sailing (although since moving to MI there has been less of that) and weightlifting. It is a long-term goal of mine to compete in an amateur powerlifting and bodybuilding competition.
                I also enjoy reading a variety of books, and sometimes write short reviews of books I have recently read, which are available <a href="reviews.html">here</a>.
